Answer 1:

Hello George,

Welcome to Algolia ! I know there are a lot of new concepts 
when you start the search engine, I'm glad to answer your questions.

To set up a search engine, the first step is to collect and store 
all the data on which you want to search. This is indexing. Unlike a data table, 
an index is optimized for search operations. For example, in an ecommerce 
website, the index would be a complete list of all products.
Algolia creates the index automatically when you add your first object, you don't
need to create it explicitly.
If you want to find out more about indexing at Algolia, you can look at this
page: https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-client/methods/indexing/.

Then, a record is an object you add to an index and want to search for.
It can contain any number of attributes.
To take the same example of the ecommerce website, one product and all its attributes
would be a record.
You can find more detail here:
https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/in-depth/what-is-in-a-record/

Finally, once everything is set up the user can search the ecommerce website. 
All returned results are accurate, but in which order should they be displayed?
Thanks to custom ranking, you are in control on which record appear in the
first results. This way, you can increase visibility for your most essential 
products.
More information about custom ranking here:

I hope this helps, don't hesitate to contact me if you have any other questions.

Have a good day,

Answer 3:

Hi Leo,


I am glad to hear you are thinking about integrating Algolia !

The integration time depends on a lot of parameters like the organization of
your data, what you want to do with Algolia, and the UI of your website/application.

Implementation time ranges from 5 minutes to a couple of weeks for the most 
complex projects, but most of our users have a complete search within one
to ten days.

Most of the work is usually to redesign and rethink the user experience
of your website or application.

To have a better overview of each step of implementations, you can check
our quick start which explains the steps involved in setting up a project:

Please feel free to send an email if you have any question during the process
set up.

Have a good day,

Best regards,

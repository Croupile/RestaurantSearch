Answer 1:

Hello George,


Welcome to Algolia ! I realize there are a lot of new concepts when 
getting started with our search engine, I'm glad to answer your questions.

To set up a search engine, the first step is to collect and store within Algolia
all the data which you want to search through. The act of storing data in 
Algolia is called indexing.. Unlike a data table, an index is optimized for 
search operations. For example, in an ecommerce website, the index would be a
complete list of all products. Algolia automatically creates the index as soon
as you add your first object: no need to explicitly create it.
If you want to find out more about indexing at Algolia, you can look at this
page: https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/in-depth/prepare-data-in-depth/.

Then, a record is an entry in the index that can be retrieved as the result of a
search. It can contain any number of attributes. To take the same example of the
ecommerce website, one product and all its attributes, such as web views, would
be a record. You can find more detail here:
https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/in-depth/what-is-in-a-record/

Finally, once everything is set up, the user can navigate through the ecommerce
website using the search functionalities, such as direct search through a search
bar, or filtering through various attributes. These relevant attributes must be
searchable in the Algolia index.

All returned results match the search criterias, but in which order should they
be displayed? With Custom Ranking, the control of this ordering is given to you.
This way, our ecommerce website, for instance, can increase visibility of
specific products, such as the ones that are discounted at the moment.
More information about custom ranking can be found here:

I hope this helps. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any other questions.

Have a good day,

Answer 3:

Hi Leo,


I am glad to hear you are thinking about integrating Algolia !

The integration time depends on a lot of parameters like the organization of
your data, what you want to do with Algolia, and the UI of your website/application.

Implementation time ranges from 5 minutes to a couple of weeks for the most
complex projects, but most of our users have a complete search within one
to ten days.

Forwarding data to Algolia and customizing the search experience doesn't
usually represent much development time, as we strive to make the product as
easy to use as possible.

However, integrating this experience and redesigning parts of a website that
doesn't yet include any type of search experience can represent a bigger chunk
of development work for your front-end teams.

A better overview of each step of the implementation and integration can be
found in our getting started guide:
https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/in-depth/implementation-process/


Please feel free to reach out again if you have any questions during the
integration process.

Have a good day,

Best regards,
